##10 minutes
1.	[Prepare] Take a moment to get comfortable before listening.
	1.1 [Four Noble Truths] The reason to practice is put an end to your stress and the stress of those around you.
		1.1.1	Stress exists in life.
		1.1.2	Stress is caused by not getting what things you want, and getting things you don't want.
		1.1.3	Stress can be stopped when you stop wanting.
		1.1.4	And there are skillful things you can practice that help to stop your stress. Meditation is one of those things.
	1.2 [Motivation] Now it's important to understand that your basic traits like intelligence, focus, concentration and the like, are not fixed; rather they and your other basic abilities can be developed through effort. You must choose to make the effort.*[source](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/)*
	1.3	[Posture] And notice the feeling of the still body, upright and yet relaxed at the same time. 
	1.4	[Notice the Senses] So just start to notice and calm the senses.
	1.5	[Body scan] As you begin to scan down from head to toe. Noticing the different areas of comfort or discomfort.
	1.6	[Object of meditation] Now take your biggest breath in, and let it out slowly, noticing the feeling of the breath somewhere in the body. The tip of the nose, the rise and fall of the shoulders, the belly expanding, wherever you like.
2.	[Count] And start by counting the breaths from one to four, starting over when you reach four. Count one with the inhale, two with the exhale.
	2.1	(In the beginning this is skillful to hear when silence goes longer than we are comfortable with:)
	2.2	If the mind wanders restart the counting once you notice, without judging.
3.	[Follow] Focus your concentration on the feeling of the breath someplace in the body. And let go of counting.
	3.1	[Follow the Breath] Follow the coming in and going out of the breath. 
		3.1.1	Notice how each breath is unique.
		3.1.2	Some long and some short. 
		3.1.3	Each breath has a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
		3.1.4	There is a moment between breaths of stillness.
		3.1.5	Eventually the breath becomes subtle, peaceful, and still. 
4.	[Stabilize] Allow one's breathing to calm down, which calms down the mind, which calms down the breath.
5.	[Contemplate what is skillful] 
6.	[Contemplate the mind] And now realize that this experience is empty of an objective self, because it arises from the mind. 
7.	[Purification] Allow the mind to be free now, letting go of any focus. Every thing is everything. 
8.	[Prepare] And now bring the attention back to the breath. Back to the body. Back to the senses. Slowly open the eyes and mindfully have a stretch.

Contemplate What is Skillful (Singles)
======================

##Contemplate the Five Remembrances (Upajjhatthana Sutta)
5. There are five things that are skillful to think about often.
	5.1	I can not avoid aging.
	5.2	I can not avoid illness or injury.
	5.3	I can not avoid death.
	5.4	I can not keep any thing forever.
	5.5 I am the owner of my thoughts, words, and actions; whether good or bad, of these shall I inherit.

##Contemplate the Four Encompassing Bodhisattva Vows (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva_vow)
5. [Contemplate what is skillful] There are four things that are skillful to contemplate to work for the relief and liberation of all sentient beings.
	5.1	Sentient beings are countless; I vow to save them all.
	5.2	Stress and delusive-desires are inexhaustible; I vow to end them all.
	5.3	There are teachings beyond-measure; I vow to learn them all.
	5.4	The Buddha's Way is unsurpassable; I vow to accomplish it.

##See Yourself as You Really Are

###The Need for Insight
5.	If the reason to practice is to end stress, let's think about what the root cause of our stress could be.
	5.1 Our stress is caused by stressful thoughts or mental habits that eventually leak out as harmful words and actions [see also - [Kleshas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleshas_(Buddhism)).
	5.2 Examples include anxiety, depression, anger, hatred, etc.
	5.3 [Attachment and Aversion] These examples are caused by the deeper mental patterns of attachment, me habitually wanting things, like pleasure; and aversion, me not wanting things, like pain.
	5.4 [Ignorance] These patterns are ultimately caused by one central belief or mental state. One of ignorance; where my mind overlays an imagined permanence onto my perception of reality. This lie I constantly construct makes me ignorant of how all things actually exist, which cause patterns of attachment and aversion, which cause all the unskilful thoughts, words, and actions. 
	5.6	With these meditations you can choose to practice your focus and concentration in an effort to analyze your mind in an effort to see all things as they really are, which is the way out of ignorance on a path that ends stress.
