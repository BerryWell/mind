======================

# The Need for Insight

## An Overview [4 Noble Truths]
1.	The reason to practice is to stop unhelpful stress.
2.	There are many ways to end stress.
3.	The most efficient way to end stress is to identify a root cause and then change it.
4.	Unhelpful stress is caused by our mind's deluded belief in a dualistic reality.
5.	Choose to calm down and focus to better analyze your mind to see all things as they really are.
	5.1 Which sees through delusion
	5.2	on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

## Contemplate the Cause of Stress
1.	The reason to practice is to stop unhelpful stress. 
	1.1	Let's think about what causes that stress.
2.	It's caused by stressful thoughts or mental habits.
	2.1	Which leak out as harmful words 
	2.2	and harmful actions [Kleshas]
3.	Examples may be anxiety, depression, anger, hatred, among others.
4	[Attachment and Aversion] Stressful thoughts are caused by our brain's patterns of wanting.
	4.1 Such as wanting things we don't have that we label good, like pleasure.
	4.2 and wanting to not have things labeled bad, like pain.
5.	[Ignorance] These are caused by the overlay of a delusional desire for eternal life, and a false belief that we and the things we covet will last forever.
	5.1	This delusion exists because our mind overlays names and labels over all of our perceptions.
	5.2 The core delusional labels split reality in half and are named this and that. 
		5.2.1	Wisdom sees
		5.2.1	This and that 
6.	We can't experience reality without the overlay of mind interfering which is why its important to mindfully train our minds to see reality as it actually exists.
7.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

## Contemplate Ending Stress
1.	Practice to stop the stress caused by a deluded and closed mind with a limited view of reality.
	1.1	Let's think about how we might end stress.
2.	We can suppress unhelpful thought patterns like anger, hatred and the like.
	2.1	We can do this by thinking deeply about the opposite thought pattern we want to change.
	2.2	To counteract hatred we can practice love
	2.3	To counteract wanting we can practice giving
	2.4	To counteract delusion we can practice wisdom through logically analyzing reality
3.	The root of all our unhelpful thought patterns is a deluded belief that overlays every one of our experiences.
	3.1	This deluded mind views reality from a fixed perspective,
	3.2	which causes all our unhelpful suffering and stress.
4.	Therefore by learning to recognize and understand this delusion in ourselves, as well as learning to analyze and logically think about reality, we will learn to see through delusion and end unhelpful stress.
5.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.


## Contemplate the Process of Delusion
1.	Practice to stop the stress caused by a deluded and closed mind with a limited view of reality.
	1.1	Let's think about the process behind this delusional belief.
2.	[Contact] First we sense things
	2.1	like light 
	2.2	through our eyes.
3.	Next our nerves communicate an electrical signal to the brain.
4.	[Name and Form] Then the mind labels the signal with names it remembers. 
	4.1	shape
	4.2	hand
	4.2	my hand
	4.4	my body
	4.5	me
5.	[Consciousness] Which makes the mind become conscious of the grouping of labels we call an experience.
6.	[Karmic formations] The mind records the experience forming beliefs.
7.	[Ignorance] Like our delusional belief that our mental experiences exist as something concrete and separate from a mental condition of consciousness.
	7.1	Beliefs are built on the experiences we remember
	7.2	which are colored by our mental vocabulary and habits. 
	7.3	If we think about things that make us angry
	7.4	we are more likely to label our experiences angrily, 
	7.5	which forms our beliefs on a foundation of anger, hatred, and suffering.
8.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

## How Labels Cause Stress by Projection
1.	Practice to stop stress caused by a deluded and closed mind stuck in the habits of craving and loathing.
	1.1	Let's think about this process of craving and loathing.
2.	First we briefly perceive a thing.
	2.1 Like a feeling in our body
2. Next we delusionally think the thing we perceive exists as a solid continuous entity, independent of thought.
3.	Then we label the thing as good or bad.
	3.1	This pleasurable feeling is good. I want it to last forever and will have stress when it is gone.
	3.2	Or, this painful feeling is bad. I hate it and will have stress as long as I have it.
4.	We think labels like good and bad, and even the notion of I, exist outside our imagination and inside the thing we are perceiving.
	4.1 Neither the body part nor the pleasure are good by default, we just label them good.
	4.2	Similarly neither the pain nor the body part containing it are bad by default, we just label them this way.
	4.3	We label based off the experiences and beliefs in our imagination. 
5.	We crave good things and hate bad things. 
6.	Our craving and hatred causes us stress, and leaks out causing stress in others.
7.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

## Insight Stops Stress
1.	Practice insight to stop stress caused by a deluded and closed mind.
2.	Observe your mind to see the way you and all things actually exist. 
3.	This is the only way to give up the false beliefs you are overlaying onto the way things really are.
	3.1	There are no external means of removing stress. 
	3.2	It is all in your mind.
4.	We practice insight by first calming our thoughts, and then using reason to explore the nature of all things, until we can focus and concentrate on what we have understood.
	4.1	As Dharmakirti said: "The abandonment of desire, hatred, and so forth, is through not seeing those in objects."
5.	When you see that all troublesome emotions, and all problems, arise from your deluded misunderstandings, you will want to get rid of all of this ignorance.
6.	When you remove this delusion, you stop creating unhelpful thoughts, which stops unhelpful words and actions.
7. Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

# How to Undermine Ignorance

## Feel the Impact of Interrelatedness
All things are relative to all things.

1.	Practice insight by thinking about how things are related through their causes and conditions.
	1.1	A six-inch line is short relative to an eight-inch line.
	1.2	An eight-inch line is short relative to a ten-inch line.
2.	Delusion is the mistaken view that people and things exist independently and outside the influence of other things and the realm of change.
	2.1	If things existed outside the influence of other things, how would those things change?
	2.2	Is there any thing imaginable that is unchangable?
3.	The way to remove this delusion is to think about the fact that all things are changeable because they exist relative to other things. They are dependent on other things.
	3.1	Where there is long, there has to be short. They don't exist through their own nature. 
4.	Let's think about a thing, like a house.
5.	Think about all the things that made this house come into existence.
	5.0.1	[1 minute] It's materials, location, and other dependencies.
	5.1	Its materials,
		5.1.1	like wood, stone, and plastic.
	5.2 location,
	5.3	and other dependencies.
		5.3.1	Like the people who built it,
		5.3.2	and the timeframe it exists as a house within.
	5.4	If we change one of these things, is it still the same house? 
	5.5	Was its soul in the thing we changed? 
	5.6	Is a flame burning on a candle now the same flame from 2 minutes ago?
6.	See how the house depending on other things conflicts with the deluded idea that the house exists as a concrete independent entity.

1.	Everything is nothing more than a set of relations.
	1.1	When this is, that is
	1.2	This arising, that arises
	1.3	When this is not, that is not
	1.4	This ceasing, that ceases.
2.	Since every thing is conditioned, relative, and interdependent, there is nothing to regard as a permanent entity; which is sometimes called ego or self or soul.
3.	To illustrate the relative nature of the things around us, let's consider a candle.
4.	It's flame burns dependent upon things, like the wax and the wick.
	4.1	When the wax and the wick are present, the flame burns.
	4.2	If either of these is absent, the flame will cease to burn. 
5.	Or consider a plant, which is dependent upon things like the seed, earth and light.
6.	See how every thing arises dependent upon causal factors, and not independently.

# Introduction
1. Hi, my name's Ryan, and welcome to Open Mind, a free app to help you develop your mindfulness to know what is going on in your head at any moment, as well as your wisdom by practicing insight, all in an effort to end your stress and the stress of those around you. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of these exercises for your brain.


2.	Finding a place where you won't be disturbed is important when you're beginning. Background noise is ok if it isn't distracting. 

3.	Science has shown that if you practice around the same time each day you are more likely to create a new skillful habit. Practicing in the same place can also be helpful.

4.	Your practice will be different every time you do it. Sometimes it's easy to maintain your focus and concentration, sometimes it's difficult and your thoughts scatter quickly and repeatedly. It's important to stick with it and notice when your attention wanders, and then start over. Try to maintain focus, fail, and try again without judging yourself. The reason we fail is so we can learn to bring our focus back.

5.	There are different postures you can use such as laying down, sitting, kneeling, standing, walking, or even doing simple repetitive tasks. The easiest and most skillful position when first starting is sitting, and it's what I would recommend starting off with. If you keep your back straight while also remaining relaxed it makes it easier to calm your breathing and your mind. 

6. And thats it, you're now ready experience a calmer, wiser, and more open mind.
