##20 minutes
1.	[Prepare] Take a moment to get comfortable before listening.
	1.1 [Four Noble Truths] The reason to practice is put an end to your stress and the stress of those around you.
		1.1.1	Stress exists in life.
		1.1.2	Stress is caused by not getting what things you want, and getting things you don't want.
		1.1.3	Stress can be stopped when you stop wanting.
		1.1.4	And there are skillful things you can practice that help to stop your stress. Meditation is one of those things.
	1.2 [Motivation] Now it's important to understand that your basic traits like intelligence, focus, concentration and the like, are not fixed; rather they and your other basic abilities can be developed through effort. You must choose to make the effort.*[source](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/)*
	1.3	[Posture] And notice the feeling of the still body, upright and yet relaxed at the same time. 
	1.4	[Notice the Senses] So just start to notice and calm the senses.
	1.5	[Body scan] As you begin to scan down from head to toe. Noticing the different areas of comfort or discomfort.
	1.6	[Object of meditation] Now take your biggest breath in, and let it out slowly, noticing the feeling of the breath somewhere in the body. The tip of the nose, the rise and fall of the shoulders, the belly expanding, wherever you like.
2.	[Count] And start by counting the breaths from one to four, starting over when you reach four. Count one with the inhale, two with the exhale.
	2.1	(In the beginning this is skillful to hear when silence goes longer than we are comfortable with:)
	2.2	If the mind wanders restart the counting once you notice, without judging.
3.	[Follow] Focus your concentration on the feeling of the breath someplace in the body. And let go of counting.
	3.1	[Follow the Breath] Follow the coming in and going out of the breath. 
		3.1.1	Notice how each breath is unique.
		3.1.2	Some long and some short. 
		3.1.3	Each breath has a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
		3.1.4	There is a moment between breaths of stillness.
		3.1.5	Eventually the breath becomes subtle, peaceful, and still. 
4.	[Stabilize] Allow one's breathing to calm down, which calms down the mind, which calms down the breath.
5.	[Contemplate what is skillful] 
6.	[Contemplate the mind] And now realize that this experience is empty of an objective self, because it arises from the mind. 
7.	[Purification] Allow the mind to be free now, letting go of any focus. Every thing is everything. 
8.	[Prepare] And now bring the attention back to the breath. Back to the body. Back to the senses. Slowly open the eyes and mindfully have a stretch.

	5.1	I can not avoid aging.
	5.2	I can not avoid illness or injury.
	5.3	I can not avoid death.
	5.4	I can not keep any thing forever.
	5.5 I am the owner of my thoughts, words, and actions; whether good or bad, of these shall I inherit.

##Contemplate the Four Encompassing Bodhisattva Vows (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva_vow)

	5.3	There are teachings beyond-measure; I will learn them all.
	5.4	The Buddha's Way is unsurpassable; I will accomplish it all.

Contemplate What is Skillful (Groups)
======================

##See Yourself as You Really Are

###The Cause of Stress
5.	The reason to practice is to stop stress. Let's think about what causes that stress.
	5.1	It's caused by stressful thoughts, which are neural pathways or mental habits.
		5.1.1 These eventually leak out as harmful words 
		5.1.2 and actions [see also - [Kleshas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleshas_(Buddhism)).
	5.2	Examples include things like anxiety, depression, anger, hatred, among others.
	5.3	[Attachment and Aversion] These are caused by our brain's patterns of wanting.
		5.3.1 Wanting things I don't have that I label good, like pleasure.
		5.3.2 Wanting to not have the things I label bad, like pain.
	5.4	[Ignorance] These are caused by a belief based on dellusion that is ignorant of the true nature of all things.
		5.4.1 This ignorance exists because our mind overlays imagination and ideas over all of our perceptions. 
		5.4.2 We cant't experience reality without the overlay of mind interfering. 
		5.4.3 Part of the dellusion is imagining things last forever and are independent and not relative to every other thing.
		5.4.4 This dellusion makes us ignorant of how all things actually exist. It causes wanting and other unskilful thoughts, words, and actions. 
	5.5	Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which is the way out of ignorance on a path that ends unhelpful stress.

###Identify My Wrong Belief (From the Middle to the Source)
5.	Practice to stop the stress caused by a wrong belief in how things really exist. 
	Let's think about how this wrong belief works.
	5.1	[Contact] We first sense things
		5.1.1	like light 
		5.1.2	through our eyes.
	5.2	[6 Sense Bases] Nerves then deliver an electrical signal to the brain.
	5.3 [Name and Form] The mind then labels the signal with names it remembers. 
		5.3.1	shape
		5.3.2	hand
		5.5.3	my hand
		5.5.4	my body
		5.5.5	me
	5.4	[Consciousness] The mind becomes conscious of the new labels.
	5.5 [Karmic formations] The mind records the labels in the brain's physical neural pathways forming beliefs.
	5.6 [Ignorance] Like our wrong belief that the labels applied in the mind exist as something other than a mental condition of consciousness.
	5.7	[Feelings] This wrong belief causes our feelings of wanting and not wanting.
	5.8 [Craving] Which causes us to crave things we label good, and hate the things labeled bad.
		5.8.1	We stress about not having things we want; 
		5.8.2	we stress about having things we don't want; 
		5.8.3	we stress about losing things we have and want to keep.
	5.9	Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which is the way out of ignorance on a path that ends unhelpful stress.

Wikipedia's ordering doesnt make sense for the 12 nidanas, and the talk page doesnt seem very legit. I found different sources for ordering, the 2nd of the 2 is the better one.	

12 Nidanas [ordering from](http://personal.carthage.edu/jlochtefeld/buddhism/wheeloflife/nidanas.html) [avidya - ignorance] ignorance is the dualistic habit pattern of good or bad, subject and object, our mind uses to [samskaras] create and strengthen neural pathways which [vijnana] creates a mental habit for consciousness to [nama-rupa] apply names and labels to [shadayatana] the electrical signals delivered to our brains from nerves receiving data from [sparsha] our organs, which gather data from reality.

Twelve Nidanas [ordering from Thich Nhat Hanh](https://tnhaudio.org/2012/12/02/a-new-teaching-on-the-twelve-nidanas/)

Avidya (delusion) past
Sanskara (impulses, actions, dispositions) past
Vij√±ana (consciousness)
Namarapa (body and mind)
Sadayatana (six sense organs and object)
Sparsa (contact)
Vedana (feelings)
Trsna (craving, attachment)
Upadana (grasping)
Bhava (existence)
Jati (birth)
Jara-marana (old age and death)
