# Introduction
1. Hi, my name's Ryan, and welcome to Open Mind, a free app to help you develop your mindfulness to know what's' going on in your head at any moment, as well as your wisdom by practicing insight, all in an effort to end your stress and the stress of those around you. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of these exercises for your brain.  


2.	Finding a place where you won't be disturbed is important when you're beginning. Background noise is ok if it isn't distracting.  

3.	Science has shown that if you practice around the same time each day you're more likely to create a skillful habit. Practicing in the same place can also be helpful.  

4.	Your practice will be different every time you do it. Sometimes it's easy to maintain your focus and concentration, sometimes it's difficult and your thoughts scatter quickly and repeatedly. It's important to stick with it and notice when your attention wanders, and then start over. Try to maintain focus, fail, and try again without judging yourself. The reason we fail is so we can learn to bring our focus back.  

5.	There are different postures you can use such as laying down, sitting, kneeling, standing, walking, or even doing simple repetitive tasks. The easiest and most skillful position when first starting is sitting, and it's what I would recommend starting off with. If you keep your back straight while also remaining relaxed it makes it easier to calm your breathing and your mind.  

6. And thats it, you're now ready experience a calmer, wiser, and more open mind.

Contemplate What is Skillful (Groups)  
======================

# The Need for Insight  

## An Overview [4 Noble Truths]  
1.	The reason to practice is to stop unhelpful stress.  
2.	There are many ways to end stress.  
3.	The most efficient way to end stress is to identify a root cause and then change it.  
4.	Unhelpful stress is caused by our mind's deluded belief in a dualistic reality.  
5.	Choose to calm down and focus to better analyze your mind to see all things as they really are.  
	5.1 Which sees through delusion  
	5.2	on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.  

## [Contemplate the Cause of Stress](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__cause-of-stress.html)  
1.	The reason to practice is to stop unhelpful stress.  
	1.1	Let's think about what causes that stress.  
2.	It's caused by stressful thoughts or mental habits.  
	2.1	Which leak out as harmful words  
	2.2	and harmful actions [Kleshas]  
3.	Examples may be anxiety, depression, anger, hatred, among others.  
4	[Attachment and Aversion] Stressful thoughts are caused by our brain's patterns of wanting.  
	4.1 Such as wanting things we don't have that we label good, like pleasure.  
	4.2 and wanting to not have things labeled bad, like pain.  
5.	[Ignorance] These are caused by the overlay of a delusional desire for eternal life, and a false belief that we and the things we covet will last forever.  
	5.1	This delusion exists because our mind overlays names and labels over all of our perceptions.  
6.	We can't experience reality without the overlay of mind interfering which is why its important to mindfully train our minds to see reality as it actually exists.  
7.	Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress.

## [Contemplate Ending Stress](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__ending-stress.html)  
1.	Practice to stop the stress caused by a deluded and closed mind with a limited view of reality.  
	1.1	Let's think about how we might end stress.  
2.	We can suppress unhelpful thought patterns like anger, hatred and the like.  
	2.1	We can do this by thinking deeply about the opposite thought pattern we want to change.  
	2.2	To counteract hatred we can practice love  
	2.3	To counteract wanting we can practice giving  
	2.4	To counteract delusion we can practice wisdom through logically analyzing reality.  
3.	The root of all our unhelpful thought patterns is a deluded belief that overlays every one of our experiences.  
	3.1	This deluded mind views reality from a fixed perspective,  
	3.2	which causes all our unhelpful suffering and stress.  
4.	Therefore by learning to recognize and understand this delusion in ourselves, as well as learning to analyze and logically think about reality, we will learn to see through delusion and end unhelpful stress.  
5.	Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress.


## [Contemplate the Process of Delusion](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__process-of-delusion.html)  
1.	Practice to stop the stress caused by a deluded and closed mind with a limited view of reality.  
	1.1	Let's think about the process behind this delusional.  
2.	[Contact] First we sense things  
	2.1	like light  
	2.2	through our eyes.  
3.	Next our nerves communicate an electrical signal to the brain.  
4.	[Name and Form] Then the mind labels the signal with names it remembers.  
	4.1	shape  
	4.2	hand  
	4.2	my hand  
	4.4	my body  
	4.5	me  
5.	[Consciousness] Which makes the mind become conscious of the grouping of labels we call an experience.  
6.	[Karmic formations] The mind records the experience forming beliefs.  
7.	[Ignorance] Like our delusional belief that our mental experiences exist as something concrete and separate from a mental condition of consciousness.  
	7.1	Beliefs are built on the experiences we remember  
	7.2	which are colored by our mental vocabulary and habits.  
	7.3	If we think about things that make us angry  
	7.4	we are more likely to label our experiences angrily,  
	7.5	which forms our beliefs on a foundation of anger, hatred, and suffering.  
8.	Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress.  

## [Contemplate Delusional Labeling](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__delusional-labeling.html)  
1.	Practice to stop stress caused by a deluded and closed mind stuck in the habits of craving and hating.  
	1.1	Let's think about this process of craving and hating.  
2.	First we briefly perceive a thing.  
	2.1 Like a feeling in our body  
2. Next we delusionally think the thing we perceive exists as a solid continuous entity, independent of thought.  
3.	Then we label the thing as good or bad.  
	3.1	This pleasurable feeling is good. I want it to last forever and will have stress when it is gone.  
	3.2	Or, this painful feeling is bad. I hate it and will have stress as long as I have it.   
4.	We think labels like good and bad, and even the notion of I, exist outside our imagination and inside the thing we are perceiving.  
	4.1 Neither the body part nor the pleasure are good by default, we just label them good.  
	4.2	Similarly neither the pain nor the body part containing it are bad by default, we just label them this way.  
	4.3	We label based off the experiences and beliefs in our imagination.  
5.	We crave good things and hate bad things.  
6.	Our craving and hatred causes us stress, and leaks out causing stress in others.  
7.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.  

## [Insight Ends Stress](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__insight-ends-stress.html)  
1.	Practice insight to stop stress caused by a deluded and closed mind.  
2.	Observe your mind to see the way you and all things actually exist.  
3.	This is the only way to give up the false beliefs you are overlaying onto the way things really are.  
	3.1	There are no external means of removing stress.  
	3.2	It is all in your mind.  
4.	We practice insight by first calming our thoughts, and then using reason to explore the nature of all things, until we can focus and concentrate on what we have understood.  
	4.1	As Dharmakirti said: "The abandonment of desire, hatred, and so forth, is through not seeing those in objects."  
5.	When you see that all troublesome emotions, and all problems, arise from your deluded misunderstandings, you will want to get rid of all of this ignorance.  
6.	When you remove this delusion, you stop creating unhelpful thoughts, which stops unhelpful words and actions.  
7. Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.  

# How to Undermine Ignorance

## [Experience Relativity](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__experience-relativity.html)  
All things are relative to all things.  

1.	Practice insight by thinking about how things are related through their causes and conditions.  
	1.1	A six-inch line is short relative to an eight-inch line.  
	1.2	An eight-inch line is short relative to a ten-inch line.  
2.	Delusion is the mistaken view that people and things exist independently and outside the influence of other things and the realm of change.  
	2.1	Think about it, if things existed outside the influence of other things, how would those things change?  
	2.2	Is there any thing imaginable that is unchangable?  
3.	The way to remove this delusion is to think about the fact that all things are changeable because they exist relative to other things.  
	3.1	Where there is long, there has to be short.  
4.	Let's think about a thing, like a house.  
5.	Think about all the things that made this house come into existence.  
	5.0.1	[1 minute] It's materials, location, and other dependencies.  
	5.1	Its materials,  
		5.1.1	like wood, stone, and plastic.  
	5.2 location,  
	5.3	and other dependencies.  
		5.3.1	Like the people who built it,  
		5.3.2	and the timeframe it exists as a house within.  
	5.4	If we change one of these things, is it still the same house?  
	5.5	Was its soul in the thing we changed?  
	5.6	Is a flame burning on a candle now the same flame from 2 minutes ago?  
6.	See how the house depending on other things conflicts with the deluded idea that the house exists as a concrete independent entity.  
7.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.  

## [Contemplate Consciousness](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__contemplate-consciousness.html)  
All things are relative to all things. 

1.	Practice insight by thinking about how consciousness exists as a continuum of relative moments.  
	1.1	Just as a moment has an end, so it must have a beginning and a middle.  
	1.2	Also the beginning, middle, and end are to be analyzed like a moment.  
	1.3 ~ Nagarjuna . 
2.	Consciousness of a grain of sand has earlier and later moments in its continuum.  
3.	These moments of consciousness make up parts of the stream of consciousness.  
4.	Even the shortest amount of time we can perceive in this continuum is made from parts.  
5.	If it didn't have a beginning, middle, and end, it couldn't join with other moments to form a continuum.  
6.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.  

## [Contemplate Space](https://openmindapp.org/meditations/insight__contemplate-space.html)  
All things are relative to all things. 

1.	Practice insight by thinking about how space exists dependent upon its parts.  
2.	Think about how space depends on its particular directions, like space in the east, and the west.   
	2.1	Think about the space of a house.  
	2.2	Think about how it depends upon its parts, the space in the bedroom, the living room, and so forth.  
3.	Consider how all space depends upon its parts.  
4.	See how space existing dependant upon its parts conflicts with the deluded idea that it exists as an independent entity.  
5.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

# WIP
======================

## Contemplate Not Self
1.	Practice insight by seeing how we exist dependent on other things.  
	1.1	When this is, that is.  
	1.2	When this is not, that is not. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da) . 
2.	See how things can exist dependent on other things, or independent, but not both.
3.	For example, think about our selves. Where do we exist? See how our sense of "I" depends upon things like our body and mind.
	3.1	If we had no heart we would cease to be, so if we replace our heart did we lose our self?
	3.2	If our thought patterns change, and our personalities change, did we cease to exist?
	3.3 Is a flame from now the same flame from two seconds ago?
	3.3	Our minds make these things exist for us. They are all built by thought dependent on our very limited human senses.
4.	See how our idea of self doesn't exist independently. It is dependent upon its causes, its parts, and upon thought.
5.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.  

## Not nihilism, not eternalism.

---

Because there are no phenomena that are not dependent-arisings, there are no phenomena that are not empty of inherent existence. p60

All things depend on other things for their existence.
Therefore all things are empty of an independent existence.

Things can either exist dependent on other things or independent. When something is one, it is not the other. 

All things have parts. The parts and the whole entity depend on each other, though they seem to have their own independent entities. This doesn't mean that the whole entity doesn't exist, it just means that it exists in dependence upon its parts.

All things depend on and exist relative to other things, therefore no things exist independently and within only their own power.

All things are empty of being under their own power as an independent, inherently-existent entity, because all things arise in dependence on other things.

1.	Practice insight by seeing how all things exist dependent on other things.  
	1.1	When this is, that is.  
	1.2	When this is not, that is not. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da) . 
2.	See how things can exist dependent on other things, or independently, but not both, and ultimately no things exist independently.
3.	For example, analyze a table to see that it exists dependent upon its parts.
	3.1	Its wood and the trees it came from, its legs, its top, and so forth.
	3.2	Nothing from within the parts is the table.
	3.3	These things that aren't a table become a table in dependence upon thought.
	3.4	A table doesn't exist independently.
	3.5	It depends on its causes, its parts, and upon thought. These are the three modes of dependent origination.
4.	As Einstein showed, things do not exist objectively in and of themselves, but exist relatively in the context of involvement with an observer.

7.	Choose to calm down and focus your concentration on analyzing your mind to see all things as they really are, which sees through delusion on a path that ends unhelpful stress for everyone.

1.	Everything is nothing more than a set of conditioned relations.
	1.1	When this is, that is
	1.2	This arising, that arises
	1.3	When this is not, that is not
	1.4	This ceasing, that ceases.
2.	Since every thing is conditioned, relative, and interdependent, there is nothing to regard as a permanent entity, ego, elf or soul.
3.	To illustrate the relative nature of the things around us, let's consider a candle.
4.	It's flame burns dependent upon things, like the wax and the wick.
	4.1	When the wax and the wick are present, the flame burns.
	4.2	If either of these is absent, the flame will cease to burn. 
5.	Or consider a plant, which is dependent upon things like the seed, earth and light.
6.	See how every thing arises dependent upon causal factors, and not independently.
