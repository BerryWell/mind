## 10 minutes
1.	[Prepare] Take a moment to get comfortable before listening.  
	1.1 [Four Noble Truths] The reason to practice is put an end to your stress and the stress of those around you.  
		1.1.1	Stress exists in life.  
		1.1.2	Stress is caused by not getting what things you want, and getting things you don't want.  
		1.1.3	Stress can be stopped when you stop wanting.  
		1.1.4	And there are skillful things you can practice that help to stop your stress. Meditation is one of those things.  
	1.2 [Motivation] Now it's important to understand that your basic traits like intelligence, focus, concentration and the like, are not fixed; rather they and your other basic abilities can be developed through effort. You must choose to make the effort.*[source](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/)*  
	1.3	[Posture] And notice the feeling of the still body, upright and yet relaxed at the same time.  
	1.4	[Notice the Senses] So just start to notice and calm the senses.  
	1.5	[Body scan] As you begin to scan down from head to toe. Noticing the different areas of comfort or discomfort.  
	1.6	[Object of meditation] Now take your biggest breath in, and let it out slowly, noticing the feeling of the breath somewhere in the body. The tip of the nose, the rise and fall of the shoulders, the belly expanding, wherever you like.  
2.	[Count] And start by counting the breaths from one to four, starting over when you reach four. Count one with the inhale, two with the exhale.  
	2.1	(In the beginning this is skillful to hear when silence goes longer than we are comfortable with:)
	2.2	If the mind wanders restart the counting once you notice, without judging.  
3.	[Follow] Focus your concentration on the feeling of the breath someplace in the body. And let go of counting.  
	3.1	[Follow the Breath] Follow the coming in and going out of the breath.  
		3.1.1	Notice how each breath is unique.  
		3.1.2	Some long and some short.  
		3.1.3	Each breath has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  
		3.1.4	There is a moment between breaths of stillness.  
		3.1.5	Eventually the breath becomes subtle, peaceful, and still.  
4.	[Stabilize] Allow one's breathing to calm down, which calms down the mind, which calms down the breath.  
5.	[Contemplate what is skillful]  
6.	[Contemplate the mind] And now realize that this experience is empty of an objective self, because it arises from the mind.  
7.	[Purification] Allow the mind to be free now, letting go of any focus. Every thing is everything.  
8.	[Prepare] And now bring the attention back to the breath. Back to the body. Back to the senses. Slowly open the eyes and mindfully have a stretch.

Contemplate What is Skillful (Groups)
======================

## See Yourself as You Really Are

### The Cause of Stress
5.	Now the reason to practice is to stop stress. So what do you think causes that stress?
	5.1	It's caused by stressful thoughts, which are neural pathways or mental habits.
		5.1.1 These eventually leak out as harmful words 
		5.1.2 and actions [see also - [Kleshas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleshas_(Buddhism)).
	5.2	Examples include things like anxiety, depression, anger, hatred, among others.
	5.3	[Attachment and Aversion] These are caused by our brain's patterns of wanting.
		5.3.1 Me wanting things I label good, like pleasure.
		5.3.2 And me not wanting things I label bad, like pain.
	5.4	[Ignorance] These are ultimately caused by a belief based on dellusion that is ignorant of the true nature of all things.
		5.4.1 This ignorance exists because our mind overlays imagination and ideas over all of our perceptions. 
		5.4.2 We cant't experience reality without the overlay of mind interfering. 
		5.4.3 It imagines things last forever and are independent.
		5.4.4 This dellusion makes me ignorant of how all things actually exist, causes wanting and other unskilful thoughts, words, and actions. 
	5.5	Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which is the way out of ignorance on a path that ends stress.

### Identifying Ignorance
5.	Now the reason to practice is to stop stress, and stress is caused by our ignorance of how things really exist. So how do you think this process of ignorance works?
	5.1	Well, first we perceive a thing with one of our senses.
		5.1.1 Light leaves the sun and travels through space and the atmosphere to bounce off an object and into our eyes.
		5.1.2 The eye converts the data it receives in multiple ways before sending an electronic signal down a nerve into our brain.
		5.1.3 Our brain then turns the signal into an experience for our mind to play with.
	5.2	Next our mind overlays the perception with an identity that we could call form or name.
	5.3	Then our mind attaches meaning to the thing, such as good or bad.
	5.4 We then start to think and stress about getting the good thing for our self and keeping the bad thing away from our self.
	5.5 If we don't get the good thing we want it causes stress.
	5.6 If we get the bad thing we don't want it causes stress.
	5.7 Choose to practice your focus and concentration to analyze your mind and see all things as they really are, which is the way out of ignorance on a path that ends stress.
