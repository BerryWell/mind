1.	[Prepare] Take a moment to get comfortable before listening.
	1.1 [Four Noble Truths] The reason to practice is put an end to your stress and the stress of those around you.
		1.1.1	Stress exists in life.
		1.1.2	Stress is caused by not getting what things you want, and getting things you don't want.
		1.1.3	Stress can be stopped when you stop wanting.
		1.1.4	And there are skilful things you can practice that help to stop your stress. Meditation is one of those things.
	1.1 [Motivation] Now it's important to understand that your basic traits like intelligence, focus, concentration and the like, are not fixed; rather they and your other basic abilities can be developed through effort. You must choose to make the effort.*[source](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/)*
	1.2	[Posture] And notice the feeling of the still body, upright and yet relaxed at the same time. 
	1.2	[Notice the Senses] So just start to notice and calm the senses.
	1.4	[Body scan] As you begin to scan down from head to toe. Noticing the different areas of comfort or discomfort.
	1.5	[Object of meditation] Now take your biggest breath in, and let it out slowly, noticing the feeling of the breath somewhere in the body. The tip of the nose, the rise and fall of the shoulders, the belly expanding, wherever you like.
2.	[Count] And start by counting the breaths from one to four, starting over when you reach four. Count one with the inhale, two with the exhale.
	2.1	(In the beginning this is skilfull to hear when silence goes longer than we are comfortable with:)
	2.2	If the mind wanders restart the counting once you notice, without judging.
3.	[Follow] Focus your concentration on the feeling of the breath someplace in the body. 
	3.1	[Follow the Breath] Follow the coming in and going out of the breath. Notice how each breath is unique.
		3.1.1	Some long and some short. 
		3.1.2	Each breath has a beginning, a middle, and an end. There is a moment between breaths of stillness.
		3.1.3	Eventually the breath becomes subtle, peaceful, and still. 
		3.1.4	It is normal to no longer notice the breath, it is calm and still, as is the mind. One should now let go of following and proceed to stabilization.
4.	[Stabilize] Allow one's breathing to calm down, which calms down the mind, which calms down the breath.
5.	[Contemplate the problem] Let's think about the problem of too much stress. What do you think is its root cause?
	5.1	[Knowing the problem helps identify the solution] What problem exists that if solved for would relieve you of your stress?
	5.2 The root cause of all of your stress, is you; or rather a wrong view of you and who you are. Your false view is one of reality that assumes every thing has a solid continuous fundamental foundation or a self.
	5.3	The solution to this problem is to recognize and experience how you actually exist, and who you really are without the overlay of false imagination and ignorance.
6.	[Contemplate the mind] And now realize that this experience is empty of an objective solid continuous fundamental foundation named self, because it arises from the mind. 
7.	[Purification] Allow the mind to be free now, letting go of any foucs. Every thing is everything. 
8.	[Prepare] And now bring the attention back to the breath. Back to the body. Back to the senses. Slowly open the eyes and mindfully have a stretch.
