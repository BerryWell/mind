		1.3.1	[Follow an Imagined Feeling] Imagine the feeling of warm light on the top of your head. Follow the warm feeling as it moves down, into the neck, the shoulders, the upper arms, the lower arms, the hands and the fingers. The upper back, the chest, the abdomen, the obliques, the lower back, the hips, the groin the backside, the front and back of the upper legs, the lower legs, the ankles, the feet and the toes. And just imagine that feeling radiating out now away from the body into the space around you. Warming any others in the area. Imagine now that it grows larger, maybe as big as a city, as big as a country, as big as the earth, the galaxy, the universe.

	1.5	[Object of meditation] And take the biggest breath possible and let it out slowly, noticing the feeling of the breath somewhere in the body. The tip of the nose, the rise and fall of the shoulders, the belly expanding, wherever you like.
2.	[Count] And start by counting the breaths from one to four, starting over when you reach four. Count one with the inhale, two with the exhale.
	2.1	If the mind wanders restart the counting once you notice, without judging.

3.	[Follow] Focus your concentration on the feeling of the breath someplace in the body. 
	3.1	[Follow the Breath] Follow the coming in and going out of the breath. Notice how each breath is unique.
		3.1.1	Some long and some short. 
		3.1.2	Each breath has a beginning, a middle, and an end. There is a moment between breaths of stillness.
		3.1.3	Eventually the breath becomes subtle, peaceful, and still. 
		3.1.4	It is normal to no longer notice the breath, it is calm and still, as is the mind. One should now let go of following and proceed to stabilization.
4.	[Stabilize] Allow one's breathing to calm down, which calms down the mind, which calms down the breath.
5.	[Contemplate what is skillful]
6.	[Contemplate the mind] And now realize this experience is empty of an objective solid continuous fundamental foundation because it arises from the mind. 
7.	[Purification] Every thing is everything. Allow the mind to be free now, letting go of any foucs.
8.	[Prepare] And now bring the attention back to the breath. Back to the body. Back to the senses. Slowly open the eyes and mindfully have a stretch.
