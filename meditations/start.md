		1.2.2	Tastes
		1.2.3	Smells
		1.2.4	Sounds
		1.2.5	Touch
	1.3	[Posture] And notice the feeling of the still body, upright and yet relaxed at the same time. 
	1.4	[Body scan]As you begin to scan down from head to toe. Noticing the different areas of comfort or discomfort.
		1.3.1	[Follow an Imagined Feeling] And shift attention to the warm feeling of a smile on the mouth. Smile and notice the warm feeling as it spreads from the mouth to the rest of the face. Notice the warm feeling spreadhing through the to the back of the head. Follow the warm feeling as it moves down, into the neck, the shoulders, the upper arms, the lower arms, the hands and the fingers. The upper back, the chest, the abdomen, the obliques, the lower back, the hips, the groin the backside, the front and back of the upper legs, the lower legs, the ankles, the feet and the toes. And just imagine that feeling radiating out now away from the body into the space around you. Warming any others in the area. Imagine now that it grows larger, maybe as big as a city, as big as a country, as big as the earth, the galaxy, the universe.

	1.5	[Object of meditation] And take the biggest breath possible and let it out slowly, noticing the feeling of the breath somewhere in the body. The tip of the nose, the rise and fall of the shoulders, the belly expanding, wherever you like.

2.	[Counting] And start by counting the breaths from one to four, starting over when you reach four. Count one with the inhale, two with the exhale.
	2.1	If the mind wanders restart the counting once you notice, without judging.

3.	[Following] Focus your concentration on the feeling of the breath someplace in the body. 
	3.1	[Follow the Breath] Follow the coming in and going out of the breath. Notice how each breath is unique.
		3.1.1	Some long and some short. 
		3.1.2	Each breath has a beginning, a middle, and an end. There is a moment between breaths of stillness.
		3.1.3	Eventually the breath becomes subtle, peaceful, and still. 
		3.1.4	It is normal to no longer notice the breath, it is calm and still, as is the mind. One should now let go of following and proceed to stabilization.

4.	[Stabilization] Allow one's breathing to calm down, which calms down the mind, which calms down the breath.
	4.1	Put to rest all things.
	4.2	Eventually one becomes aware of the body and mind seeming to vanish entirely as one enters meditative absorption. 
		4.2.1	This state of intense concentration is blissful.
		4.2.2	This state is ultimately empty of a permanent, independent, inherently existent entity.

5.	[Contemplate the body] And now think and try to find an independent self in your body.
	5.1	And now start to think about your body (and the nature of all of objective reality).
	5.2	Of how it (and all things) are impermanent. 
	5.3	Of how it is made of smaller parts, with empty space between them all.
	5.4	And how all its parts exist relative to all its parts.

6.	[Contemplate the mind] And now think and try to find an independent self in your mind.
	6.1	And now start to think about how your mind is the source of every thought, every experience, and every thing that you have and are made up of. 
		6.1.1	[Confidence] You appear to be what you think. If you think positively, you will be more positive.
		6.1.2	[The view] The truth is that you are not what you think, because you are empty.
	6.2	Realize that your self, and all the things in existence, are ultimately empty and still.
	6.3	No one thing can be found because all things are empty.
	6.4	Realize that every thing exists relative to every other thing. 

7.	[Purification] An independent self is not findable in you or in any other thing, as every thing is made from, makes up, and is relative to, every other thing. Allow the mind to be free now, letting go of any foucs.

8.	[Preperations] And now bring the attention back to the senses. Back to the body. Back to the breath. 
	8.1	Remember this has been a practice for active life.
		8.1.1	Carry your new experiences of patience and focus through into active life.
		8.1.2	Make skillful and compassionate choices to benefit yourself and all other living beings.
	8.2	So when you're ready just slowly open the eyes and mindfully have a stretch.
